    "In order to have a better model of the real velocity of the wheels when we give an input to the motor we performed measures to obtain a linear regression of the datas. To do so we used the method shown in the Lab 8 of the course to estimate the velocity of the robot by measuring the time it took it to cross several white strips which are detected by the ground sensor. It gave the following results : "
