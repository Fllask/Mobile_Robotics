    "One of the main challenge of this project is to use filtering in order to estimate the exact position of the robot over time. However there are only few sensors at our disposal to do so and there isn't a direct mapping between them and the values of the states used for the control of the robot. There are three sensors at our disposal : \n",
    "1. Motor speed sensors : they give the current value of the wheels' speed. They have a large bandwith but because of their limited precision the integration of the speed results in position drift over time. They also are quite sensitive to environmental noise.\n",
    "2. Accelerometer : It gives the current value of the acceleration, as for the Motor speed sensors even if it has a large bandwith its limmited precision results in speed and position drifts.\n",
    "3. The camera : By using pattern recognition the camera can be used as a position sensor, however due to projection errors and noise it has a low precision on the position measurements, especially regarding the measurements of the angle theta of the robot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the control of the robot relies only on its speed, it was decided to only use the **motor speed sensors** and the **camera** to get the measurements of the robot states."

    "The kalman filter is an efficient recursive filter which is used to estimate the states of a dynamic system through a series of uncomplete or noisy measurements. It is broadly used in robotic for motion planning, speed or position estimation. The Filter relies on the estimation of the belief by using means vector and covariance matrices which follows multinormals probabilistic laws and therefore allows for efficient sensor fusion. Hence by using it in addition of our control law it allows the estimation of the real position of the robot over time in order to achieve better accuracy and precision in its control."
